# Printing on Terminal

## `echo`
`echo` command in linux is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument . This is a 
built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen 
or a file.

`echo` puts a newline at the end of every echo invocation by default:

```bash
                        $ echo "Welcome to Bash"
                        Welcome to Bash
```

Simply, using double-quoted text with the echo command prints the text in the terminal. Similarly, text without double 
quotes also gives the same output:

```bash
                        $ echo Welcome to Bash
                        Welcome to Bash
```

Another way to do the same task is by using single quotes:

```bash
                        $ echo 'Welcome to Bash'
                        Welcome to Bash
```


The side effects of each of the methods are as follows:

 * When using echo without quotes, we cannot use a semicolon, as it acts as a delimiter between commands in the Bash shell

    * `echo hello; hello` takes `echo hello` as one command and the second `hello` as the second command
  
 * Variable substitution, will not work within single quotes.
 
   ```bash
                    $ a=10
                    $ echo '$a' # prints $a on terminal instead of value of a
                    $ echo "$a" # prints 10 on termianl correctly.
   ```

Following options are available to modify the behaviour of `echo` command 
   
* `-n`	do not append a newline
* `-e`	enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes
* `-E`	explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes
    
`echo` interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:
```
      \a	alert (bell)
      \b	backspace
      \c	suppress further output
      \e	escape character
      \E	escape character
      \f	form feed
      \n	new line
      \r	carriage return
      \t	horizontal tab
      \v	vertical tab
      \\	backslash
 ```
### Examples

```bash

                        $ echo "One \nTwo"
                        One \nTwo
                        
                        $ echo -e "One \nTwo"
                        One 
                        Two
                        
                        $ echo -e "I \bam"
                        Iam
                        
                        $ echo "hello world."
                        hello world
                        $
                        
                        $ echo -n "hello world"
                        hello world$

```

## `printf`

`printf` command in Linux is used to display the given string, number or any other conversion specifier on the 
terminal window. It works the same way as `printf` works in programming languages like C. By default, `printf` 
does not have newline as in the `echo` command. We have to specify a newline when required. `printf` takes quoted 
text or arguments delimited by spaces. We can use **formatted strings** with `printf`. We can specify string width, 
left or right alignment, and so on.

#### Conversion Specifier
A  character  that  specifies  the  type  of  conversion  to  be  applied.  The conversion specifiers and their 
meanings are:

* `%d` for integer number.
* `%f` for floating point number.
* `%s` for string.
* `%o` for octal number.
* `%x or X` for hexadecimal number.
* `%e or %E` for floating point in scientific notation. 
* `%%` to print %.

```bash
                      $ a=10
                      $ b=20.45
                      $ c="hello bash"
                      
                      $ printf "Value of a is: %d\n" $a
                      Value of a is: 10
                      
                      $ printf "value of b is: %f\n" $b
                      value of b is: 20.450000
                      
                      $ printf "value of b is: %e\n" $b
                      value of b is: 2.045000e+01
                      
                      $ printf "value of b is: %E\n" $b
                      value of b is: 2.045000E+01
                      
                      $ printf "%d equivalent in octal is: %o\n" $a $a
                      10 equivalent in octal is: 12
                      
                      $ printf "%d equivalent in hexadecimal is: %x\n" $a $a
                      10 equivalent in hexadecimal is: a
                      
                      $ printf "%d equivalent in hexadecimal is: %X\n" $a $a
                      10 equivalent in hexadecimal is: A
                      
                      $ printf "welcome to %s.\n" $c
                      welcome to ceit.

```
#### Field Width and Precision

* To specify a minimum field width an optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) can be used. If the converted
value has fewer characters than the field width, **it will be padded with spaces on the left. To pad on the right use `-` character.**

* To print the floating point number up to particular precision, an optional precision, in the form of a period ('.')
followed by an optional decimal digit string can be used.

```bash
                      $ str="ceit"
                      $ num=45.3546
                      $ c=10
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %10d..\n" $c 
                      value of num is:         10..
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %-10d..\n" $c
                      value of num is: 10        ..
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %f\n" $num
                      value of num is: 45.354600
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %.2f\n" $num
                      value of num is: 45.35

                      $ printf "value of num is: %.2e\n" $num
                      value of num is: 4.54e+01
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %10.2f$\n" $num
                      value of num is:      45.35$
                      
                      $ printf "value of num is: %-10.2f$\n" $num
                      value of num is: 45.35     $

                      $ printf "welcome to %s.\n" $str
                      welcome to ceit.
                
                      $ printf "welcome to %10s.\n" $str
                      welcome to       ceit.

                      $ printf "welcome to %-10s.\n" $str
                      welcome to ceit      .

```

Format capabilities of `printf` are perfect for complex output tasks when writing in scripts and help to avoid code repetition. As an illustration suppose you want to print a file `score.txt` on terminal. `score.txt` file contains

```
                                      id name cpi
                                      101 ram 9.11
                                      102 shiv 8.75
                                      103 krishna 9.5
                                      104 ravi 8.45
                                      105 jai 7.98
```
We can use single printf statement to print the whole file.

```bash
                $ printf "%-10s %-10s %-10s\n" $(cat score.txt)
                id         name       cpi       
                101        ram        9.11      
                102        shiv       8.75      
                103        krishna    9.5       
                104        ravi       8.45      
                105        jai        7.98    

```
# `printf` vs `echo`

Both `echo` and `printf` are built-in commands. echo always exits with a `0` status, and simply prints arguments 
followed by an end of line character on the standard output, while `printf` allows for definition of a formatting 
string and gives a non-zero exit status code upon failure.

printf has more control over the output format. It can be used to specify the field width to use for item, 
as well as various formatting choices for numbers.

For trivial messages (no escape sequences, no options), `echo` is fine. As soon as you need something more complex, 
you shoud use `printf` which is portable (i.e. behave the same regardless of the OS) and allows much better formatting.
