# 1. Introduction to Linux Operating System

An operating system(OS) is an essential component of the system software. OS acts as an interface between the user of 
a computer and the computer hardware. OS is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and offers 
common services to the application programs. One such OS is Linux.

Linux is one of the popular versions of UNIX-based operating System. It is open source as its source code is freely available. 
It is free to use. Linux was designed considering UNIX compatibility. Its functionality list is quite similar to 
that of UNIX.

**Linux operating system architecture primarily has three components:**

   - Kernel
   - Shell
   - Utilities

## 1.1 Kernel
The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages the following resources of the Linux system –
  * File management
  * Process management
  * I/O management
  * Memory management
  * Device management etc.

It is often mistaken that Linus Torvalds has developed Linux OS, but actually he is only responsible for development of 
Linux kernel.
```
Complete Linux system = Kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + 
                        other management scripts + installation scripts.
```

## 1.2 Shell
A shell is a special user program which provides the user an interface to use operating system services. Shell accepts 
human readable commands from a user and converts them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command 
language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets 
started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.

There are several shells available for Linux systems like –

 - **BASH (Bourne Again SHell)** Is the most widely used shell in Linux systems. It is used as the default login shell in
    Linux systems and in macOS. It can also be installed on Windows OS.
    
 - **CSH (C SHell)** The C shell’s syntax and usage are very similar to the C programming language.
 
 - **KSH (Korn SHell)** The Korn Shell also was the base for the POSIX Shell standard specifications.

**Each shell does the same job but understands different commands and provides different built in functions.**

# 2. General Purpose Utilities

## 2.1 `uname`

`uname` command prints system information. syntax of uname command is `uname [option]`
```
                $ uname -s   ## prints the kernel name
                Linux   
                
                $ uname -n   ## prints the network node hostname
                ceit
                
                $ uname -r   ## prints the kernel release
                5.0.0-13-generic
                
                $ uname -v  ## prints the version of current kernel
                #14-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 15 14:59:14 UTC 2019
                
                $ uname -m ## prints the machine hardware name
                x86_64
                
                $ uname -p   ## prints the processor type or "unknown"
                x86_64
                
                $ uname -i  ## prints the hardware platform or "unknown"
                x86_64
                
                $ uname -o  ## prints the operating system
                GNU/Linux
                
                $ uname -a 
                Linux ceit 5.0.0-13-generic #14-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 15 14:59:14 UTC 2019 x86_64 
                x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
`uname -a` prints all the system information in the following order: Kernel name, network node hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, hardware platform, operating system.


## 2.2 `cal`

If a user wants a quick view of the calendar in the Linux terminal, `cal` is the command to use. By default, the `cal` command 
shows the current calendar month as output. `cal` command is a calendar command in Linux which is used to see the calendar 
of a specific month or a whole year.

```bash
               $ cal                    
                     May 2019        
               Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
                         1  2  3  4  
                5  6  7  8  9 10 11  
               12 13 14 15 16 17 18  
               19 20 21 22 23 24 25  
               26 27 28 29 30 31     
               
               
               $ cal 02 2019          # calendar of feb 2019
                  February 2019      
               Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
                               1  2  
                3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
               10 11 12 13 14 15 16  
               17 18 19 20 21 22 23  
               24 25 26 27 28  
               
               
               $ cal -3 # shows the calendar of previous current and next month.
               
                                                          2019
                      April                  May                   June

                                                           30                    

```

## 2.3 `date`

`date` command is used to display the system date and time. `date` command is also used to set the date and time of 
the system. By default the `date` command displays the date in the time zone on which unix/linux operating system 
is configured.You must be the super-user (root) to change the date and time.

- When used without options, the `date` command displays the current system date and time, including the day of the week, month, time, timezone, and year:
 
```bash
         $ date
         Mon 06 May 2019 12:30:25 AM -04
```
- date has many display formatting options.
```
               %D: Displays date as mm/dd/yy.       
               %d: Display the day of the month (01 to 31).       
               %a: Displays the abbreviated name for weekdays (Sun to Sat).
               %A: Displays full weekdays (Sunday to Saturday).
               %h: Displays abbreviated month name (Jan to Dec).
               %b: Displays abbreviated month name (Jan to Dec).
               %B: Displays full month name(January to December).
               %m: Displays the month of year (01 to 12).
               %y: Displays last two digits of the year(00 to 99).
               %Y: Displays four-digit year. 
               %T: Displays the time in 24 hour format as HH:MM:SS.
               %H: Displays the hour.
               %M: Displays the minute.
               %S: Displays the seconds.
```
- syntax for display formatting is: `$date +%[format-option]`
```bash
            $ date "+%D"
            05/06/19

            $ date "+%D %T"
            05/06/19 00:38:09
            
            $ date "+%Y-%m-%d"
            2019-05-06
            
            $ date "+%Y/%m/%d"
            2019/05/06

            $ date "+%A %B %d %T %y"
            Monday May 06 00:39:01 19
```

## 2.4 `who`

`who` command is used to find out the following information :
1. Time of last system boot
2. Current run level of the system
3. List of logged in users and more.

* The `who` command displays the following information for each user currently logged in to the system if no option is
provided :
   - Login name of the users
   - Terminal line numbers
   - Login time of the users in to system
   - Remote host name of the user
   
```bash
            $ who
            ram      :0           2019-05-05 21:11 (:0)
```
* To show the list of users currently logged in use `who -u`.
```bash
            $ who -u
            ram      :0           2019-05-05 21:11   ?          1513 (:0)
```

* To show the headings of the column use `who -H`.
```bash
            $ who -uH
            NAME     LINE         TIME             IDLE          PID COMMENT
            ram      :0           2019-05-05 21:11   ?          1513 (:0)
```

* To show time of the system when it booted last time use `who -b`
```bash
            $ who -b
            system boot  2019-05-05 21:09
```

*  To count number of users logged on to system `who -q`
```bash
            $ who -q
            ram
            # users=1

```
